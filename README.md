Notes for Brian to run this software:
	Install all necessary modules (such as opencv (cv2))
	Run in terminal using "python3 detector.py"
	First you will need to run "python3 trainer.py"
	Then run "python3 detector.py"

	trainer.py will remember your face
	detector.py will use stored data and should recognize your face
