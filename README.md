Notes for Brian to run this software:
	Install all necessary modules (such as opencv (cv2))
	Run in terminal using "python3" not "python" unless you changed default path to python3
	First run "python3 record_face.py"
	Then you will need to run "python3 trainer.py"
	Finally run "python3 detector.py"

	record_face.py will remember your face
	trainer.py will train recog info to recognize your face
	detector.py will use stored data and should recognize your face
